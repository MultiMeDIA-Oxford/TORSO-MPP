This pipeline is designed to take cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images from the UK Biobank (Petersen, Matthews et al. 2013) and reconstruct the subjectâ€™s torso surface and localise their ECG electrode locations. The workflow is illustrated below. The reference for the pipeline, including its architecture, its validation, and a demonstration of its clinical value is:
